# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# 999*999 = 998001 so the number won't be larger than six digits
# 100 * 100 = 10000 so the smallest the number could potentially be is five digits, but since we're looking for the largest number I think it's more likely to be six digits

#so there are two steps here: first to find palindromic numbers, then to see if they are the product of two three-digit numbers
